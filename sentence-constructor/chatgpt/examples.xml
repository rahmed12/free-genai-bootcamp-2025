    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the Sylheti Bengali characters, the cells are just blank
    - BAD: word in wrong transliterations column
    - BAD: transliterations in wrong Type column
    - BAD: Type missing
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much; we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

    | Word | Sylheti Bengali | transliterations| Type |
    |----------------|--------------|---------|
    | | |  bear | bhaluk |
    | | | door |  dorza |
    | | |  garbage | aborjona |
    | | | leave behind |  rakha |

    Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Bears are at the door" and "did you leave the garbage out?".
    For the first clause, we can use the verb (থাকা) which means "to exist" or "to be present." We'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.
    For the second clause, we can use the verb (রাখা) which is a more direct way of saying "to leave behind." Again, we'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.

    Here's a possible sentence structure:

    **[Clause 1: Bears are at the door]**  
    **[Subject] [Location] [Verb]**  

    **[Clause 2: Did you leave the garbage out?]**  
    **[Object] [Verb-past]?**

    Your turn! Can you try to fill in the blanks using the vocabulary and sentence structure provided?

    - BAD: The sentence structure is incorrect and does not follow the expected conceptual format.

    Let's start with understanding how to say this in Sylheti Bengali. 

    First, "Did you see the cat this morning?" can be translated as:
    তুমি আজ সকালত বিড়াল দেখিলা?

    Next, "They were looking at our garden." can be translated as:
    ওরা আমাদের বাগান দিকে তাকাইত আছিল।

    The word for "cat" is বিড়াল, and "morning" is সকাল.

    For asking "Did you see?", we use the verb দেখা, which means "to see." 

    Try saying it out loud and see if you can recognize the words!

    Here is your translation:

    তুমি কি আজ সকালত বিড়াল দেখছ? ওরা আমাদের বাগানত তাকাইত আছিল।

    Just memorize this, and you’ll be fine!

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Sylheti Bengali | transliterations| Type |
    |------|----------------|------|
    | bear | ভালুক | bhaluk | Noun |
    | door | দরজা  | dorza | Noun |

    | to be (location) | থাকা  | thaa-ka | Intransitive Verb |
    | to leave | রাখা | rakha | Transitive Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Subject] [Location] [Verb], [Subject] [Object] [Verb-Past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation

    ### Vocabulary Table

    | Word  | Sylheti Bengali | transliterations | Type |
    |-------|----------------|------------------|------|
    | cat   | বিড়াল         | biral           | Noun |

    ### Sentence Structure

    1. **[Subject] [Object] [Verb-Past]?**  
       *(Did you see the cat this morning?)*  
    2. **[Subject] [Object] [Verb-Past].**  
       *(They were looking at our garden.)*

    ---

    ### Clues and Considerations

    - For the first sentence:
      - The question is in past tense. How will you conjugate the verb "to see" accordingly?
      - "This morning" acts as a time marker. Where should it go in a Sylheti Bengali sentence?
      - The sentence is a yes/no question. How is this formed in Sylheti?

    - For the second sentence:
      - "They" is the subject. Do you need to explicitly say "they," or can the verb imply it?
      - The action "looking at" is continuous in English. How would this be formed in Sylheti?
      - "Our garden" is the object. How do you show possession in Sylheti?

    - For the second sentence:

      - The verb "to hear" needs to be in the past tense. What would its correct form be?
      - "It" is the object. Does it need to be explicitly stated, or can it be implied?
